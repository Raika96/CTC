## Connectionist temporal classification (CTC)

Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) has been introduced to overcome not knowing the alignment between the input and the output in tasks like speech recognition or Handwriting recognition.

This repostiroy provides implementaiton of CTC from scratch using NumPy.
The back-end of CTC Forward-Backward algorithm is implemented in CTC class. 
The forward and backward functions of CTC can be called separately.
